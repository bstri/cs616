## Quick Start
To get up and running as quickly as possible, open the feature computation and model training notebook inside Jupyter notebook or Google CoLab. 

Then, you can execute all cells and it will proceed to define and train a model on the training data that it automatically downloads from this repository.

The model can be tweaked readily and trains very quickly. After the model runs, metrics are computed below.

## Feature Computation
To go through the process of computing features for each bug report/src file pair the commit data must be available. This data is large and therefore is not stored on this repository, but can be generated in the other .ipynb notebook. 

**Note that computing this commit data is a time consuming process!**

To see what the resulting feature computation is without doing this process you may open the trainingData250.csv file in this repository.
